        <h2>Inside the Cupola</h2>
        <p>The Cupola provides astronauts with a panoramic view of Earth and space through its seven windows, making it the perfect place for observation and photography.</p>
        <p>Equipped with a robotic workstation, the Cupola allows astronauts to control the Canadarm2 robotic arm, facilitating tasks such as spacecraft docking and external maintenance operations. This functionality is crucial for the International Space Station's (ISS) operations and maintenance.</p>

        <h2>History & Purpose</h2>
        <p>The Cupola module, built by the European Space Agency, was launched aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour in February 2010. Its seven windows provide panoramic views of Earth and serve as the primary control station for robotic operations aboard the International Space Station.</p>
        <p>Installed on February 15, 2010, the Cupola has become an iconic feature of the ISS, symbolizing international collaboration and the human desire to explore and understand our planet from space.</p>
