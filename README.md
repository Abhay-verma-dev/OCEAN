## üåç Solution Summary

We created two immersive, joystick-driven experiences that let users explore unique aspects of ISS life and history:

* **Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) Experience** ‚Üí Simulates astronaut training underwater, giving users a feel of how astronauts prepare for spacewalks.
* **Cupola Experience** ‚Üí Places users inside the ISS‚Äôs Cupola observation module, where they can look out at Earth and experience the station‚Äôs iconic vantage point.

Both are controlled using an intuitive virtual joystick, with overlays that provide educational context about ISS modules, experiments, and milestones.

* **Interactive controls** via joystick, keyboard, or gamepad
* **Educational storytelling** tied to real ISS history and science
* **Mobile-friendly design** for accessibility and engagement
* **Expandable framework** for AR/VR and more immersive storytelling in the future

This transforms the ISS‚Äôs 25-year story into an active, exploratory journey rather than passive reading.
