## 🛰️ Problem Statement

Develop an app (or interactive experience) to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the International Space Station (ISS), fostering public engagement, education, and awareness of its scientific, technological, and social impacts.

## 🌍 Solution Summary

We’ve developed two interactive, joystick-driven experiences that allow users to actively explore life and history aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Each simulation combines realistic visuals, intuitive controls, and educational storytelling to offer an authentic glimpse into astronaut training and life in orbit.

1. Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) Experience
This experience simulates astronaut training inside NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory—an enormous underwater facility that replicates the effects of microgravity. Users gain an understanding of how astronauts prepare for extravehicular activities (EVAs), or spacewalks, in an environment that mimics weightlessness. Through interactive controls, they can maneuver, stabilize, and work with tools, gaining insight into the discipline, coordination, and focus required for space missions.

2. Cupola Experience
The Cupola Experience places users inside the ISS’s iconic observation dome, known as the Cupola. From this panoramic module, users can witness stunning real-life visuals of Earth—sunrises, continents, oceans, and city lights—while exploring the station’s systems and environment. The Cupola serves as the “window to the world,” offering astronauts an inspiring and emotional connection to their home planet.

3. Benefits of the Cupola to Humans Living on Earth
Beyond its value to astronauts, the Cupola provides meaningful benefits to people on Earth through both emotional impact and scientific contribution.

🌍 Perspective and Awareness: The Cupola helps cultivate the Overview Effect, a profound realization of Earth’s unity and fragility. This perspective fosters global awareness, environmental consciousness, and a deeper appreciation for our planet’s interconnected systems.

💚 Emotional and Psychological Connection: By recreating the Cupola’s view, users experience the same sense of awe and gratitude astronauts feel when gazing at Earth, inspiring empathy, peace, and mindfulness about humanity’s shared home.

🌦️ Climate and Environmental Monitoring: The Cupola also plays a vital scientific role. Through its high-visibility vantage point, astronauts and researchers can observe weather systems, track natural disasters, and collect visual data that supports climate forecasting and environmental research. This contributes to improved understanding of atmospheric changes, ecosystem health, and global climate trends.

Together, these benefits transform the Cupola from a viewing window into a bridge between space exploration, environmental awareness, and humanity’s responsibility toward Earth.
